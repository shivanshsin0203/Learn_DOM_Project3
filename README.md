# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Project_3

Welcome to this repository! This project showcases the power and flexibility of JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation capabilities.

## Description

This project demonstrates various techniques of interacting and manipulating web page elements using the DOM API in JavaScript. By traversing, modifying, adding, or deleting nodes, we can create dynamic and interactive web experiences.

## Features

- **Element Selection**: Using methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, and `querySelector`.
- **Event Handling**: Attaching event listeners to elements to respond to user actions.
- **Dynamic Content Creation**: Programmatically creating and injecting new elements into the DOM.
